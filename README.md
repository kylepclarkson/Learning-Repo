## Counterfactual Regret Minimization
---
This folder contains code that is dicussed in Neller's and Lanctot's "[An  Introduction to Counterfactual Regret Minimization](http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf)". 
It discusses the idea of **regret** in two-player games which, when we choose some action $s_i$ and our opponent chooses action $$s_{-i}$$, is a quantity assigned to all other actions we could've taken $$s_{i}'$$. 
This quantity is defined interms of the utilities for these other actions.
